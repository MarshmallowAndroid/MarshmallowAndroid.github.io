            <strong>General details</strong><br>
            The program started as mere testing grounds for an open source implementation of an audio codec that a lot
            of Japanese video games use; CRIWARE's HCA format.
            After a bit of tinkering I decided to delve a little deeper into reverse-engineering the Unity assets. For
            downloading said assets,
            <a href="https://github.com/OpenMLTD/MLTDTools">OpenMLTD</a>, a project that figured out the asset
            downloading side of things helped a ton. I eventually
            ended up using their download code in MirishitaMusicPlayer.<br>
            <br>
            A lot of the mechanisms used by the game to play back music videos aside from baked animation is by using a
            sequence of events triggered at a certain time.
            The triggering of these events can be viewed from the music player itself. Events are sent as a payload
            containing the event ID, and its data.
            For instance, event ID 43 controls the lipsync, and the <code>Param</code> property contains which mouth
            shape (A, I, U, E, O) to apply.<br>
            <br>
            During playback, the program caches all relevant events (the ones it can show), like the "mute" or the parts
            that control which character is supposed to be
            singing, the lights, the facial expressions, the lipsync, etc. in order to display them for visualization.

                responsible for this functionality</a>.<br>
            <br>

            <strong>RGB Plugin</strong><br>
            RGB functionality is implemented via a plugin system where the library is dynamically loaded during song
            playback and unloaded on finish. This makes it easier to debug since you only have to stop the song in order
            to rebuild the plugin. The song light targets (the ID of which type of light will be triggered during the
            event)
            for choosing the source of lights to use for the RGB peripheral/s and the song ID for identification are
            passed to the plugin
            during initialization.<br>
            <br>
            Light events in the scenario will call the <code>UpdateRgbAsync()</code> function. An important thing to
            note is that the light events consist mainly of the light target, its colors, and the duration of the light
            transition from one color to another. The implementation of the transition animations will be up to
            the developer.

            for OpenRGB and SteelSeries per-key keyboards can be found in the repository.<br>
            <br>
            The plugin system also allows for a settings or configuration window to be shown when clicking the "RGB settings..." button in the player.
